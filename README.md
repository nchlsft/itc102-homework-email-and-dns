Email and DNS

Emails are messages that are sent electronically through the World Wide Web between email servers. It is possible to trace an email by looking into the header to find the IP (Internet Protocol) address. Googling the IP address will give you the physical address that the email was sent from. During the class exercise on emails I was able to trace my email back to my group partner who was sitting next to me. I was also able to see that my Twitter updates were coming from San Francisco. 

DNS stands for domain name system. It translates the domain names into IP addresses and routes emails to where they are suppose to go. When your operating system on your computer doesn’t know the IP address for a website it asks resolving name servers, which is provided by your internet service provider. If the resolving name server doesn’t have the website in its cache, then it will ask the root name servers. The resolving name servers will take information from the root name servers to find the TLD (com) servers if the root servers don’t have the address. If there is still no info the resolving name server will check with the ANS servers. By then the resolving name server has found the IP address and returns it to your computer's operating system.
